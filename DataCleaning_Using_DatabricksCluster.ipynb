         "background : my 18f ex boyfriend 18m really wanted me to abort our son 3 months when i was pregnant and resented me for not doing so and fell out of love with me over it . throughout my pregnancy he threatened to kill himself multiple times and frequently self harmed and said its because id made him very depressed and anxious and pushed him to his limits by keeping the baby - i had told him he was free to walk away from me and the baby and i wouldnt chase him up over it or money but he chose to stay and said he wants to be in his sons life . over the past year he has started antidepressants and changes dosage / pill type very regularly obviously prescribed but has been known to skip pills or take several in a day to double up etc. . exbf cut ties with me two days before my due date for another woman he wanted to give things a go with but still talks about ending his life and mentions his super low mood to me when he sees the baby and is frequently pretty nasty to me . he sees our son 3 months typically once a week , sometimes twice up to him , i do nt limit it in my family home and we do nt leave him with the baby alone because he isnt too capable . for a long time he struggled with the practicals eg feeding and changing but hes never been around many babies and is slowly improving - so this isnt much about that . he spends most of the time he has the baby holding him but watching tv or on his phone , he pays little attention to him really . when i pop to the corner shop or chemist etc or go shower i ask my sister or mum to sit with them . our son is still young but some family members have been suggesting soon he will be old enough to spend time with my ex alone eg him take him for a few hours in the day or just even alone in the house but I am not sure i can fully trust my ex . i do nt think he would actively seek to hurt the baby / want to but I am not sure if the background above justifys my choice or if I am overreacting obviously a very brief summary of my reasoning . can anyone shed some light on this ?",
